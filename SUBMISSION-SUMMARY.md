# PS Security Hands-On Technical Audition Submission

## Project: Globomantics Defense Protocol - Anomaly Detection and Security Automation

### Overview
This lab simulates a defensive security scenario where participants take on the role of a Globomantics security engineer to implement automated detection and response capabilities against attacks from the notorious Dark Kittens hacking group.

## Key Features of the Lab
This security automation lab provides:

**Complete Hands-on Security Experience:**
- Participants learn incident detection and response automation
- Practice using real security tools and techniques

**Orchestration and Automation:**
- All environment setup is automated
- No manual configuration required

**Realistic Scenario:**
- Engaging storyline with the Dark Kittens threat group
- Realistic attack patterns based on common TTPs

**Comprehensive Learning Environment:**
- Covers the full security operations lifecycle
- Includes monitoring, detection, response, and reporting


### Estimated Completion Time
The lab is designed to be completed in approximately 15-20 minutes, once the environment is set up and depending on previous experience and how your system is configured.

### Answers to Submission Questions

1. **Experience with Bash, PowerShell, or Terraform**:
   This lab demonstrates my experience with Bash and Python scripting and JSON for configuration for security automation tasks, including system setup, process monitoring, and security response actions. I've utilized Bash for creating automated workflows that respond to security events. I've also used Python for more complex monitoring and analysis tasks, showing how these technologies can be combined effectively in security operations.

2. **Environment Diagram**:
   A network diagram is included in the repository showing the components of the lab environment. The environment consists of a simulated attacker, a monitoring system, a response system, and the necessary log files and configuration data. 


### Technical Complexity
The lab demonstrates technical complexity through:
- Real-time monitoring of log files for security incidents
- Pattern matching using regular expressions to detect attack signatures
- Automated response actions based on threat type and severity
- Report generation with detailed metrics and visualizations
- A complete security operations workflow from detection to response

### Creativity
The scenario involves defending Globomantics' artificial island against the Dark Kittens hacking group, adding an engaging storyline to the technical exercises. The lab simulates various attack patterns including port scanning, brute force attempts, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration, providing a comprehensive security scenario.

### Completeness
The lab automation eliminates all unnecessary steps, allowing participants to focus on the security concepts rather than environment setup. All required components are automatically configured by the setup script, and clear instructions guide participants through each task. 

### Environment Description
The lab runs entirely locally on either an Ubuntu or Windows machine with the following components:
- A simulated attacker system (represented by simulation scripts)
- A security monitoring system (Python-based)
- An automated response system (Bash-based)
- Simulated logs and configuration data

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For monitoring systems and attack simulation
- **Bash**: For response actions and environment management
- **JSON**: For configuration and threat intelligence data
- **Local file system**: For simulating logs and attack detection
